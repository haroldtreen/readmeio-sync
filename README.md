# readmeio-sync
A tool for making local Readme.io development a breeze!

### 1) Tool Setup:
When readmeio-sync becomes available on npm, this process will be less 'linky'.

```
git clone git@github.com:mobify/readmeio-sync.git
cd readmeio-sync
npm link
cd ../<your_readmeio_project>
npm link readmeio-sync
```

### 2) Credential Setup:
The script will log into Readme.io for you in order to upload files. For this to work, it needs your credentials!

Tell `readmeio-sync` your credentials by setting the following environment variables like so.

```
export README_EMAIL=<readmeio_account_email>
export README_PASSWORD=<readmeio_account_password>
```

### 3) Config Setup:
`readmeio-sync` differentiates between your production/staging projects through the `syncConfig.json` file.

You can set the name of these projects using the `config` command.

```
readmeio-sync config -s <staging-project-slug> -p <production-project-slug>
```
This will generate the `syncConfig.json` file with the proper keys set.

### 4) Project Initialization:
Initialization allows you to download all your existing content from Readme.io. 

It also creates a new `syncRegistry.json` file which represents the structure of your documenation and links to all your local content files.

Initialize using the `init` command.

```
readmeio-sync init
```

This will use the `production` slug that you should have configured in step 3.

### 5) Project Upload:
Upload allows you to push updated content to Readme.io. This might include:

* New categories, docs or custom pages you've added to the registry files.
* Changes in content files.
* Changes to document titles or excerpts.
* Changes to the way you want to order content.
* etc.

Once your project has been initialized and has a config, you can upload using the upload command.

```
readmeio-sync upload [--production]
```
Including the production flag will push the content to production.

### 6) Cleaning Readme.io:
When you remove content from your registry file, it does not auto-magically delete it from your Readmeio project too. Upload only does updates and creates.

If you have out of date content on your Readmeio project, you can use the `clean-remote` command to remove all content that is not specified in your registry file.

```
readmeio-sync clean-remote [--production]
```

This will look at the state of your project, compare it to the state of your registry, and delete whatever is not specified locally. This will be done for staging unless the production flag is set.

*(**Note**: If you remote clean a project and it removes all the documentation, Readmeio will not allow you to go into the documentation section. You will need to upload new content with the `readmeio-sync upload` command to get it working again.)*


------
## The Registry File
`readmeio-sync` tracks all your content using the `syncRegistry.json` file. This file is created during initialization. 

Here is an example registy file:

```json
{
    "adaptive-restructing-test": {
        "v1.0": {
            "documentation": [
                {
                    "title": "Overview",
                    "pages": [
                        {
                            "body": "adaptive-restructing-test/v1.0/documentation/Overview/What is Adaptive.js?.md",

                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### Explanation of the Sections

#### Project Root
The top level key is the slug for the project the registry is representing.

```json
"adaptive-restructing-test": {...}
```

#### Versions
Within the top level object are all the hosted versions of the documentation.

```json
"adaptive-restructing-test": {
	"v2.0": {...},
	"v1.0": {...}
}
```

#### Documentation
Each version has a documentation object, which is an array of categories.

```json
"v2.0": {
	"documentation": [
    	{
			"title": "Overview",
			"pages": [...],
		},
		{
			"title": "Getting Started",
			"pages": [...]
		}
	],
	...
}
...
```

#### Category Pages
Each category has as array of page objects.

```json
{
	"title": "Overview",
	"pages": [
		{
			"body": "adaptive-restructing-test/v1.0/documentation/Overview/What is Adaptive.js?.md",
			"excerpt": "Documentation page description!",
			"title": "What is Adaptive.js?"
		}
	]
}
```
- `body`: Path to the documentation content (written in Readme.io flavored Markdown)
- `excerpt`: Description of the document
- `title`: Title of the document

#### Custom Pages
Each version will have a section for custom pages. `customPages` is an array of objects representing custom pages.

*(Currently there is a Readme.io bug which does not allow versioned pages. As such, only use one custom pages section for all versions.)*

```json
"v2.0": {
	"customPages": [
    	{
			"title": "Adapting Desktop Markup",
			"html": "www/categories/adapting-desktop-markup.html",
			"selector": ".c-readme-body"
		},
		{
			"title": "Adding Interactivity",
			"html": "www/categories/adding-interactivity.html",
			"selector": ".c-readme-body"
		}
	]
	...
}
...

```

- `title`: The title of your custom page
- `html`: A path to the custom pages html
- `selector` (Optional): The selector key can be used to select a subset of the html in the specified html file. This can be useful if you are generating your custom pages and only need part of the generated html.

#### Custom Content
The custom content object let's you upload a stylesheet (Dashboard > Appearance > Custom Stylesheet) as well as html for the landing page (Dashboard > Appearance > Landing Page (Body Content)).

```json
"v2.0": {
	"customContent": {
		"selector": ".c-readme-body",
		"appearance": {
			"html_body": "www/index.html",
			"stylesheet": "www/css/main.css"
		}
	}
}
...

```
- `selector` (Optional): Can be used to select a subset of the html specified in the html_body file
- `appearance`: Necessary object expected by the api
- `html_body`: Path to the landing page html file
- `stylesheet`: Path to a css stylesheet

### Content Organization
When using the web interface, you can drag and drop categories/documents to change their overall ordering. Ordering of documentation is important to ensure that their is a natural progression from top to bottom.

With Readmeio-sync, ordering is determined by the order objects are specified in the `syncRegistry.json`.
To change the order of documentation categories and pages, simply rearrange them in the `syncRegistry.json`.

### Known Issues
1. Doing a remote-clean when you have no documentation in your `syncRegistry.json` file will cause all your documentation on readme.io to be deleted (after all, you are saying "delete all the things I don't have specified locally"...which is nothing!). Having no documentation causes Readme.io to break (you can't enter the documentation section of the site). To fix this you will have to add a document to your `syncRegistry.json` and upload it...or get in contact with Readme.io and admit you were using internal APIs (OOPS!).

1. Custom pages are not versioned. Ideally they would be, and that's why the "customPages" section exists in each version of the `syncRegistry.json`. When you initialize a project, the same custom pages will be downloaded for both versions and specified seperately in the `syncRegistry.json`. If you try and upload while the pages are specified in both versions, duplicates will be created. <br/><br/> **You can fix this by:**
<br />1. Deleting all the custom pages in all versions except one (however if you `clean-remote` with this configuration, all custom pages will be deleted and you'll have to upload again). <br/>2. `clean-remote` after each upload.
